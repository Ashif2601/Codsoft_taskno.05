## 🏫 Student Management System — GUI (Java Swing)

The **Student Management System (GUI Version)** is a Java-based desktop application built using **Swing** and **Object-Oriented Programming**. It allows users to manage student records interactively with a graphical interface rather than a console.

This project demonstrates GUI development, event handling, serialization, CRUD operations, and data persistence in Java.
